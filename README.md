## Motivation

You are ready a textbook for revision. You have an exam coming up. What would you do?

Anki! Of course it is great to have some flashcards to remember important facts. However, creating Anki cards alongside reading isn't smooth. You often have to switch context and think about what cards to create.

Try Geeder. We use LLM (Ollama / Claude / ChatGPT) to create Anki cards, and add to your existing Anki decks. Copy a section from the textbook, paste into Geeder, and your new cards are just one button away!
