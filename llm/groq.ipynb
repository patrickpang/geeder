    "1A.6 years of life lost\n",
    "One way to measure the impact of a health problem is to estimate how many years people might have lived had their lives not been cur- tailed by it. For example, deaths from road traf- fic collisions affect mostly young males who would otherwise have been expected to live into their 70s or 80s.\n",
    "Years of life lost (YLL) is a measure of prema- ture mortality and, as such, it explicitly places more importance on deaths that occur in young people than those in older people. YLL is there- fore a value-laden statistic, which reflects the gen- eral wish of society to prevent avoidable causes of death in younger people and to avoid the loss to society of its investment in raising children and in supporting young adults.\n",
    "To calculate YLL in its most simple form, an upper age limit (e.g. 75) is chosen. A person who dies at the age of 60 contributes 15 YLL (75 − 60 = 15) to the calculation, and a person who dies at age 15 contributes 60 YLL. Deaths occurring in peo- ple aged over 75 are not included in the calcula- tion. Infant deaths may or may not be included.\n",
    "For example, the total YLL in a population may be calculated as\n",
    "∑(Deaths at each age 1 year ×74) +(Deaths age 2 years×73)\n",
    "+...+(Deathsage74 years×1)\n",
    "In more complex calculations, an actuarial assessment is undertaken of the expectation of life for each person, where life expectancy is cal- culated using current life tables and age-specific mortality rates are applied to a hypothetical population (see Section 3B.6).\n",
    "Note that YLL will underestimate the burden of disease due to chronic conditions, which typi- cally have a low mortality in young people. To account for this phenomenon, health-adjusted life expectancy (HALE) may be used instead of the crude life expectancy, where\n",
